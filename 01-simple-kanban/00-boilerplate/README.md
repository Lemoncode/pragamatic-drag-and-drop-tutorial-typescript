# Boilerplate

This is the starting point for the simple Kanban example.

To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the example:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And open the browser at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

If the port is busy, it will use the next available port (e.g., localhost:5174).

Now, open the readme in ./01-board and follow the step-by-step guide. I hope you find it useful :), if you find any errors or something that can be improved, feel free to make a PR or open an issue.
