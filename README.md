# 🧩 Pragmatic Drag & Drop Examples

Welcome to the Pragmatic Drag & Drop Examples repository! This project aims to simplify and enhance the learning experience for developers exploring the [Pragmatic Drag & Drop](https://github.com/atlassian/pragmatic-drag-and-drop) library by Atlassian.

- 🇪🇸: [Guide in Spanish](https://github.com/Lemoncode/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-tutorial-typescript/blob/main/README_ES.md)

## 📝 Overview

The Pragmatic Drag & Drop library by Atlassian is a powerful tool for implementing drag-and-drop functionality in web applications. In their [tutorial section](https://atlassian.design/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/tutorial), Atlassian provides interesting examples using a chessboard to explain the basics of drag-and-drop.

However, these examples have some drawbacks:

- 📄 The code is a bit hard to follow because everything is in a single file.
- 💄 The examples use the Emotion library for CSS, which can be distracting due to the additional dependencies.
- 🛠️ If you download the code from CodeSandbox to run locally, you may encounter issues during installation and execution due to version conflicts.

## 🔧 What Have We Done?

To address these issues, we have:

- 🧹 Simplified the example by removing unnecessary dependencies, such as Emotion, and using plain CSS instead.
- 📂 Organized the project into folders and files to make the code more modular and easier to understand.
- 📚 Created step-by-step guides in markdown format for each example, allowing you to reproduce the examples easily.

We hope these improvements will make it easier for you to follow along and learn how this fantastic library works.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Additional explanations and details will be added to further enhance the learning experience.
- Add more example extending the current tutorial.
